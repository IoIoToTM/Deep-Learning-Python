Implementation of Tensorflow using MNIST data

01. Using simple linear regression and predicting test labels referenced from tensorflow site

02. Using intuitive prints to visualize images and weights . Also plotting confusion matrix to find out false positives

03. Using a simple CNN to predict test labels and visualizing various results on tensorboard. Also implementation of tensorboard embeddings for predicted labels and images. ```tensorboard --logdir=tensorboard/mnist_cnn --port=8080```
