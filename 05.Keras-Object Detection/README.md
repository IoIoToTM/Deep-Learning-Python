2. This example contains the implementation of YOLOv2 in Keras with Tensorflow backend from scratch. The model was trained of a set of f1 racecars and was successfully able to detect the same in images and video. Due to memory constraints , the training data size was reduced. A more effiecient way would be to implement a tinyYOLO net if you have a lack of GPU memory or any other resource constraints.
